# Uptimemesh 🚀

**UptimeMesh** is a **Web3 SaaS project**: a decentralized uptime monitoring platform. Unlike traditional monitoring tools that rely on centralized servers, Uptimemesh uses a **global network of distributed computers** to check the status of websites and services. Users get **instant alerts** if downtime is detected, ensuring faster response and higher reliability.
